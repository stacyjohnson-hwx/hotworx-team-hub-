# HOTWORX Team Hub — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Internal web application for HOTWORX studios (multi-studio support).
Replaces paper checklists, group texts, and spreadsheets with a centralized, role-aware
daily operations tool for studio owners, managers, and TSA staff.

**PRD source:** `HOTWORX_TeamHub_PRD.docx` (same directory as this file)

## CRITICAL: Production Deployment

**This app is LIVE in production on Vercel + Railway. DO NOT use localhost URLs.**
**The ONLY way to ship is `git push` to `main` on GitHub — never "deploy to local."**

- **Frontend (Vercel):** Auto-deploys from `main` on GitHub
  - **Correct Vercel project:** `hotworx-team` → **`https://hotworx-team.vercel.app`** ← the real app
  - ⚠️ **DO NOT confuse with the Vercel project named `hotworx-team-hub`** — that project is a
    *different, unrelated site (Walk Your Plans / "WYP")*. If a preview shows "WYP", you are
    looking at the wrong Vercel project. The local `.vercel/project.json` may also point at the
    wrong (`hotworx-team-hub`) project — ignore it for deploys; the GitHub→`hotworx-team`
    integration is what actually ships this app.
- **Backend (Railway):** Auto-deploys from `main` on GitHub
  - **Backend URL:** `https://hotworx-team-hub-production.up.railway.app`
- **GitHub repo:** `stacyjohnson-hwx/hotworx-team-hub-`

**Deploy workflow (do this after EVERY change):**
1. `git add <files>` → `git commit -m "…"` → `git push` (to `main`). Confirm the push output shows `… -> main`.
2. Run `git log origin/main..HEAD` — it must be **empty** (proves nothing is stuck local-only).
3. Verify the change on **`https://hotworx-team.vercel.app`** (NOT the `hotworx-team-hub` Vercel project).
4. If a feature isn't live: check the Vercel **`hotworx-team`** project's latest deployment for a **build failure**
   (a failed build freezes the site on the previous version), and check Railway for 502s.
5. DO NOT test against localhost unless explicitly asked.

## Multi-Studio Architecture

**This app supports multiple HOTWORX studios.** Each user can be assigned to one or more studios with a specific role per studio.

**Current Studios:**
- HOTWORX Pewaukee (WI0009) - `studio_id: 3abc6af6-37b8-4c13-b761-a92b5204ca25`
- HOTWORX Madison (WI0021) - `studio_id: 3dd138e4-3393-4cb3-a1b2-0cc54719ab2d`

**How it works:**
1. `user_studios` junction table maps users to studios with roles
2. Frontend: `StudioContext` loads all studios user has access to
3. Frontend: `currentStudio` is saved to `localStorage.selectedStudioId`
4. Frontend: `useApi` hook sends `X-Studio-ID` header with every request
5. Backend: `requireStudio` middleware validates header and attaches `req.studio`
6. Backend: All queries filter by `studio_id`

**All data is studio-specific:** competitors, events, promotions, B2B contacts, coaching sessions, todos, studio trends, cleaning tasks, schedules, etc.

## Users & Roles

Three roles with distinct permissions. Role is stored per studio in the `user_studios` table.

| Role | Who | Notes |

| `owner` | Stacy Johnson | Full access including private modules |
| `manager` | Bailey Boche | Full operational access; no owner private to-do |
| `tsa` | Chrissy, Synneva, Bryn, Marisa | View-only for most modules; complete tasks + EOD |

**Permission matrix per module:**

| Module | owner | manager | tsa |
|--------|-------|---------|-----|
| Schedule | edit | edit | view own + team |
| Goals (Studio) | edit | edit | view |
| Goals (Personal) | edit | edit | view own |
| Lead Generation | edit | edit | edit (daily actuals) |
| Events & Promos | edit | edit | view |

## Commission Calculation Logic

Used in the Personal Goals module. Must match exactly:

### EFT Commission
- Monthly quota = $500 EFT increase (≈ 10 memberships at avg $50/month)
- ≤ $500 EFT increase → **15%** commission on total collected at POS
- > $500 EFT increase → **30%** commission on total collected at POS

### Membership PIF (Paid In Full)
- 12-month or longer term → **10%** on collected payments
- 6-month or longer term → **5%** on collected payments

### Retail
- $1,000–$1,999 individual retail sales → **10%**
- $2,000–$2,999 individual retail sales → **11%**
- $3,000+ individual retail sales → **15%**

### In The Bank (ITB) Bonus
- Monthly goal met → **$50 flat bonus**
- Monthly goal exceeded by ≥10% → **$100 flat bonus**
- Manager can manually override bonus amount (rare PIF edge cases)

## Email Delivery

### EOD Nightly Digest
- **Trigger:** Cron job at 10:00 PM CT (`America/Chicago`) daily
- **Also triggers:** Immediately when a Closing shift EOD is submitted
- **Recipients:** `stacy.johnson@hotworx.net` + `manager.wi0009@hotworx.net`
- **Subject:** `HOTWORX Pewaukee — EOD Report [Date]`
- **Format:** One section per shift submitted; clean HTML table
- **Alert:** Drawer variance > $5 highlighted in red

### In-App Notifications (no email)
- Order request created (Manager notified)
- Time-off request submitted (Manager notified)
- Time-off request approved/denied (TSA notified)
- Cleaning tasks incomplete at 9 PM (optional Manager alert)

---

## Data Architecture Notes

### Month-Based Historical Navigation
All time-sensitive records include a `month` (1–12) and `year` column.
The global month/year selector in the nav bar filters all modules.
- Current month = default view
- Past months = read-only for TSA; editable for Owner + Manager

### Recurring Records
- B2B partner discounts marked `ongoing=true` auto-carry to each new month
- Promotional offers marked `ongoing=true` auto-carry monthly
- Cleaning task recurrence is rule-based (not row-copied per month)

### Cleaning Task Frequencies
| Frequency | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Daily | Appears every day; resets at midnight |
| Weekly | Appears on configured day of week |
| Monthly | Appears on configured day of month |
| Quarterly | Appears on 4 manager-set dates per year |
| One-Off | Appears on one specific date; disappears after completion |

## Deployment Rule — Always Push After Every Change

**After completing any feature, fix, or update — always commit and push to GitHub immediately.**
Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend) auto-deploy on every push to `main`.
Never leave changes only on the local machine. The live app at Vercel is what the team uses daily.

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "Description of change"
git push
```

---

## Local Development

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3001
```

## Key External Links Referenced in EOD Checkout

- Sales training videos spreadsheet: stored as env var `SALES_VIDEO_URL`
- Sales GPT: stored as env var `SALES_GPT_URL`
  (Both linked in the EOD checkout Sales Training section — do not hardcode URLs)

---

## Supabase Setup Notes

1. Create project at supabase.com (free tier)
2. In Auth → Configuration: disable email confirmation for internal app
3. Create users manually in Supabase dashboard (no self-signup)
4. Set role in `app_metadata` for each user: `{ "role": "owner" | "manager" | "tsa" }`
5. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
6. RLS policies should check `auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role'`
